      <p>I am currently a college student pursuing a degree in Information System and Data Science with a minor in Internal Audit at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I am originally from Atlanta, Georgia. While I am at school I work for the Center for Academic Success as a Supplemental Instructor for Microeconomics. I have had this job a school for about 1.5 years now. I am currently enrolled in 19 credit hours because a professor told a class I was in to soak up as much as we could while we have the chance. I am currently pursuing my Network+ and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certifications.

      I have created all of the materials on this page from scratch and due to policy I am not allowed to post them through the school for students to access, but I think these are to benefit students, so I have coded my own website to host these materials.</p>
